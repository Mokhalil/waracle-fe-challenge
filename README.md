# Waracle Front-end Code test

The solution consists of two main folders
Feature : which contains all the feature screens
Core : contains code that will be used across the solution.

- All the code the interact with the Cat Api is encapsulated in api>agent.ts which is a wrapper around axios library.
- I've used Mobx for state management. All the stores are in core>stores folder.
- The solution is developed using Typescript
- I've used Formik and Yup for the forms management and validation
- I've used TailwindCSS to style the application.
- I've not got round to write unit tests.
